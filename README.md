## What is it?

At the moment of writing, it's been ~2 years since I started using Nx and it's been so great an experience I now use Nx for everything I can.  
So this is an attempt to start collecting all of my relevant Open Source work in a mono-repo.

For now, this means only one project:

  - [@trumbitta/nx-plugin-openapi](packages/nx-plugin-openapi/README.md)  
Keep your API spec files in libs in your mono-repo, and auto-generate sources
